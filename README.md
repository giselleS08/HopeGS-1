My project , Dreams, is about a goose trying to grow a seed. The player goes throughout the story, completing obstacles in order to see my interpretation of the cycle of hope. 
I made this project during the GirlsWhoCode Summer program which prompted us to make a game on our interpretation of hope. I interpreted hope as a plant trying to grow as well as using feeling of losing hope.
How you made your project
I made my project using the p5play library and coded on replit.
I struggled a lot with my sprites and how they interacted with the player and other sprites. Most of the time sprites would collide with other sprites, making them run all over the screen. Also, when the player would click or use keys on the keyboard, the barrier and mud sprites would never listen. I ended up going to the p5play library, digging around to solve the problems. TUrns out I forgot the sprite.collider ="k" made sprites stop being disrupted by other sprites and I wrote the code wrong for dragging sprites which is sprite.mouse.dragging() insteand of .presses().[![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)
